# üå± Mulch Roadmap

**Last updated:** July 7, 2025

Welcome to the Mulch project roadmap! This document outlines where the project is headed, what features we're planning, and how you can help shape the journey.

---

## üåü Vision

Mulch is a fast, flexible scaffolding CLI for Python (and beyond). It helps you spin up clean, consistent project structures with one command‚Äîwithout needing to start from scratch every time.

Our goal is to make `mulch src` the best "starter kit" CLI for real-world development.

---

## üîë Key Feature

`WorkspaceManager` is the quarterback, you are the coach.
 
When you rollout `workspace` directories that reflect your `mulch-scaffold` file, a matching `workspace_manager.py` file is generated. Getters from your customized `WorkspaceManager` class can be used from within your source code to easily reference your configuration files, imports, exports, secrets, and more.

## Folder Stucture Options, using `mulch src`

| Flag        | Workspace Location   | Source Location      | Goal                        |
| ----------- | -------------------- | -------------------- | --------------------------- |
| *(none)*    | `workspaces/<name>/` | `src/<proj>/`        | Normal development use      |
| `--here`    | `./<name>/`          | *(none)*             | Clean, user-facing          |
| `--stealth` | `./<name>/`          | `.mulch/src/<proj>/` | Play nice with shared dirs  |

I am really excited about `mulch src --stealth` for mixed use directories. Business and engineering users can organize projects in a shared drive like SharePoint, while a dev can run custom analysis scripts catered to each type of project.

## üöß In Progress

These features are currently being developed or actively discussed:

- [ ] Clarity for nested folder paths in `mulch.toml`   
- [ ] Consider moving to a `mulch-scaffold.toml` standard, to include helpful comments and instructions.
- [ ] Basic test suite for CLI and config parsing
- [ ] Use and test generated introspective WorkspaceManager classes for passing imports, exports, configs, etc, to ensure stability.
- [ ] First version of contributor docs (`CONTRIBUTING.md`, templates)

---

## üß≠ Planned for `1.0.0`

These are the milestones we want to hit before releasing `v1.0.0`:

### ‚ú® Features
- [ ] Validate `mulch.toml` with clear errors
- [ ] Solidify the `mulch.toml` nesting structure, backed up with clear documentation.
- [ ] Allow `.yaml` and `.toml` config as an alternative to JSON
- [ ] Inline documentation for scaffold files

### üîê Stability & Testing
- [ ] Lock down the `WorkspaceManager` API, with features for library import and scripting.
- [ ] CLI regression tests using `pytest` + `click.testing`
- [ ] Add `py.typed` marker for better editor support

### üì¶ Project Health
- [ ] Complete `CHANGELOG.md` and semver versioning
- [ ] Setup GitHub Actions for CI
- [ ] Contributor guide + issue templates

---

## üí° Ideas for the Future

These are not commitments, but open ideas we‚Äôre exploring:

- [ ] Includes standard template choices for `mulch.toml`, for various expected project types. 
- [ ] Jinja2-style variable substitution in templates, for distributable files in a `root/.mulch` file.
- [ ] `mulch add` command for inserting modules into an existing scaffold.
- [ ] VS Code extension for scaffold previews?
